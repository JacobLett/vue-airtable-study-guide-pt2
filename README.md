Here we take what we did in part one and add the ability to edit a study card.

## Learning Projects

I learn best by looking at the code others have written and using those examples to build new things.

I am often frustrated with the lack of simple, to-the-point code examples. 

The majority of tutorials online are long and teach too many things. I spend a lot of time just breaking these up into absorbable chunks, and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time doing so.

The short projects I publish are my attempt to provide succinct illustrations of a handful of new concepts along with a few ideas on how to practice.

Any and all constructive feedback and requests are very welcome.
